# The Constitution of India
The Constitution of India, with each amendment as a commit.

## Credits
Hugely benefited by the work done in https://github.com/captn3m0/constitution and https://github.com/anoopdixith/TheConstitutionOfIndia/

## Goals
As I read more on Indian political history, I'll add more details around what went around any amendment: what were the geo-socio-political reasons for the amendment, who was supposed to be benefited, what were the oppositions, were there any judicial reviews and/or repeals on the amendment acts, who were the justices then, what were their verdicts.
In due course, I want to capture the development of the Constitution along with the context in which the development took place (and takes place further)

To achieve the said objective, the first step is to document all the changes, as they happened, in a way a software developer can browse through.
